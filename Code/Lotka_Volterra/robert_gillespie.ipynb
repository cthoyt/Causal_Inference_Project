    "### Lotka-Volterra model\n",
    "This is a simple dynamic model of the populations of a single predator species and a single prey species in an ecology that does contain any other species.  Three basic events occur in this system:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A prey spawns a new prey\n",
    "2. A predator eats a prey and immediately spawns a new predator\n",
    "3. A predator dies\n",
    "\n",
    "The population of these species in time depends on the rates at which these events occur.  If predators eat the prey too often, the prey die out then the predators die out. If the predation occurs to rarely of course the prey population explodes.  Of course the rates that these events occurs at a particular point in time depends on the populations at a specific point in time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Gillespie algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "The Gillespie algorithm is an algorithm for modeling this type of systems as a discrete state continuous time Markov process.  This means the events' occurance rates are used to calculate the probability an event will occur at a specific instant in time (hazard rate), then forward simulating using the hazard rates."
