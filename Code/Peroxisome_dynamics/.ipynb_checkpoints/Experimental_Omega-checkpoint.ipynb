    "1. Determine biochemical process that generated the experimental data and program this into Omega\n",
    "    1. An example of this is a Gillespie simulation (although it doesn't need to be)\n",
    "2. This implementation can run simulations which follow the same biochemical laws as the experiment\n",
    "    1. For a given set of cells $X$ we can generate traces over some time period $T$ \n",
    "    2. For each time point $t_i$ in $T$ we can describe the cell abundance as $P(x_1, x_2, .., x_n|t_i)$\n",
    "3. We can condition the implementation on our experimental data to recreate the experimental state\n",
    "    $$\\sum\\nolimits_{t_i \\in T} P(x_1, x_2,.., x_n|\\text{Data}, t_i)$$\n",
    "4. Use Omega's functionality (ie replace) on the conditioned trace to ask counterfactual queries about the experiment"
